Wherever crests hit each other they make lines of maximum displacement called <b>antinodal lines</b>. Wherever crests hit troughs they cancel each other out and form <b>nodal lines</b>. If projected on a wall, the ends of antinodal lines will show up as bright spots and the ends of nodal lines will be dark spots.</p>\n",

    "<h3><center> &lambda; = (6.31 x 10<sup>-5</sup>)(1 x 10<sup>7</sup>) = 631 nm</center></h3>\n",

    "<p><b> Problem 2: When 500.0 nm light is shone through a diffraction grating the distance from one 3rd order image to the other 3rd order image on the display wall is 30.0 cm. If the distance from the grating to the projection screen is 2.0 meters what is the diffraction grating in lines/inch?</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To solve this problem we first need to determine <b>&Theta;</b>. <b>(x)</b> is the distance on the display wall from the zeroeth order to the 3rd order so it would only be 15.0 cm or 0.15 meters.</p>\n",
    "<h3><center> So...  tan&Theta; = x/L = 0.15/2 = 0.075</center></h3>\n",
