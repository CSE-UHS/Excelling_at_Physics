Although you could create each physics program with all VBA code, this book won't be taking it that far. We will still be using the spreadsheet to do most of our work for us, however we will be creating VBA userforms which act as impressive GUIs (Graphic User Interfaces). When a user opens up your Excel program instead of seeing a spreadsheet, they will see what looks like a GUI for an app. The user can enter some data and click a button and the GUI will display output data in the form of text or even graphs.\n",
