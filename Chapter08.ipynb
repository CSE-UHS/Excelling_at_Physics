    "<img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/8_spring.gif\" style=\"float: right;\">In this chapter we will examine the conservation of energy within the harmonic motion of an oscillating spring. A user will enter only two inputs: the elasticity constant (k) of a spring and the mass (kg) that is oscillating on the spring. The maximum velocity of the mass and the period of the oscillation will be the two outputs. We also will be able to click a spinner button to lower and raise the spring. When this happens we will see the conservation of energy in a bar graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the given mass is hung on the spring it stretches down to a rest position. By using the following equation for the elasticity constant we can rearrange and solve for the distance the spring will be stretched. We will have to first convert the mass to weight (force).\n",

    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-6.png\"></center>\n",
    "This will be the half-way point if the mass was dropped. It will also be the location where the velocity of the falling mass will be a maximum. At this point the Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) will be 1/2 as much as the total energy (TE) and the rest of the energy will be split evenly between Elastic Potential Energy (EPE) and the Kinetic Energy (KE). So according to the following derivation we will be able to calculate the maximum velocity and output it onto the userform.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-8.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also can very simply calculate the Period (T) of oscillation for the mass and output it onto the userform using the following equation:\n",
    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-7.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the entire height that the mass will fall we will multiply the distance we calculated earlier by 2. When the mass is first dropped all of the energy is in the form of GPE. The spring has not been stretched at all and the mass is not moving. Once the mass starts falling, the GPE will decrease because it is losing height. The KE will increase because the mass is gaining velocity. The EPE will also increase because the spring is being stretched. \n",
    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-2.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the midpoint, the GPE will be 1/2 of what it was and the EPE and the KE will be equal. The KE will be at a maximum because at this point the mass will have its maximum velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-1.png\"></center>\n",
    "At the bottom, the GPE will now be zero. Since the mass is no longer moving the KE will also be zero. The EPE will be at its maximum since the spring is stretched the entire distance.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/Eqt8-3.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point along the oscillation of the mass, the total energy will not change according the following conservation law. At the top, the total energy is all GPE and at the bottom it is all EPE.\n",

    "\n",
    "Later we are going to use a spinner on the userform to increase and decrease the height by the <b>K3</b> interval each time.

    "Finally, we're going to try to create a graph that will look like a spring oscillating up and down. We will do this by making 2 data series on the same graph.

When I graphed these two points I made the line be yellow and I put a marker on the end that was red which represents the mass. <b>A8</b> of course will be changing as the spinner on the userform is controlled. This graph won't actually work unless we put another full length spring on the same graph. The second point of the second data series is <b>(0, -J3)</b>. <b>J3</b> is never changing and therefore will allow the other graph to move correctly. The second data series graph should be made the same color as the background because we don't actually want it to be visible.\n",
