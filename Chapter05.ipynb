    "<img src=\"http://www.hermonswebsites.com/PyNotebooks/Excelling/projectile.png\" style=\"float: right;\">In this chapter we want to examine the motion of a projectile. We will attempt to derive two complicated equations. The first equation is not too complicated and will be used in the unique case when a projectile shoots and lands on the same horizontal plane. (crosses the x-axis in the figure on the right.) In this example the vertical displacement (S) is actually zero.<br><br>\n",
    "The second equation we will derive will be much more complicated. It will be a quadratic equation that results when the projectile lands on a plane higher or lower than the plane from which it is  launched. A projectile landing on a higher plane is called an \"elevated target\" and would have a displacement of +S. A projectile landing on a lower plane is called an \"elevated launcher\" and would have a displacement of -S.<br><br>\n",
    "In the figure on the right we see that the Velocity of the projectile is the resultant of a horizontal velocity <b>(V<sub>x</sub>)</b> not affected by gravity and a vertical velocity <b>(V<sub>y</sub>)</b> which is affected by gravity. Using &theta; and right triangle trig we can easily derive the following two velocity equations which we will use in our derivations:\n",

    "V<sub>y</sub> = Vsin&theta;</h3>\n",

    "We designate down as the negative direction and up as the positive direction so you will always substitute in a negative gravity. When you solve for the angle keep in mind that there are actually TWO angles that will give the same range. The other angle is complementary. So after you calculate your first angle, subtract it from 90&ordm; to obtain your second angle. Feel free to watch the video below on the range equation derivation:\n",
