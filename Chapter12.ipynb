    "\n",
    "<p>Real images are formed by converging rays of light actually passing through the image point, which means they can actually be projected onto a screen. This can only happen with parabolic (concave) mirrors. Real images are always inverted (upside down) relative to the object and can be larger or smaller than the object.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Virtual images are formed by rays of light that appear to have diverged from the image but do not actually pass through it. They cannot be projected on to a screen. They are always erect (right side up) with respect to the object and can also be larger or smaller than the object. Plane mirrors always produce virtual upright images that are the same size as the object and appear to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. Virtual images are also formed when an object is located inside the focal length of a concave mirror. This image will be bigger than the object. Convex mirrors also form virtual images but these will always be smaller than the object.</p>\n",
