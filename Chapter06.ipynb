In our example, three cars with different masses and velocities will all crash together and become stuck. In any collision the combined momentum of all objects before the collision is equal to the combined momentum of all objects after the collision. This is called the conservation of momentum. This means that if I can add the three momentum vectors of the individual cars together vectorally before the collision, then this will be equal to the momentum of the 3-car combo after the collision.\n",

    "In <b>ELASTIC</b> collisions the kinetic energy would also be conserved, however, we only come close to elastic collisions at the atomic level. Most everyday collisions are very <b>INELASTIC</b>, which means that kinetic energy is lost. In our program we will need to calulate the % KE lost during the collision.
