A vector is a measurement with a magnitude and a direction and drawn as an arrow. By direction we mean an angle. For example, 50 Newtons @ 23˚. In this book, our direction will be what we call a \"heading\" which means we will measure clockwise from North. Therefore due North is 0˚, due East is 90˚, due South is 180˚ and due West is 270˚.<br><br>\n",
    "When we have multiple vectors all working on the same object we often want to determine what single vector applied to the object would give the same result. To determine this, we \"add\" all the component vectors together to give us what we call a <b>\"resultant\"</b> vector.\n",
    "<h1>Vector Example Review</h1><br>\n",
    "Let's do an example problem to review how to add vectors. What is the resultant vector that you would get by adding the following three vectors togther?\n",

    "</ul></h3>\n",

    "We then can use trig functions to \"resolve\" all three of them into their x and y components. A unit length in the x-direction is written as <b>î</b> and pronounced <b>i-hat</b>. A unit length in the y-direction is written as <b>ĵ</b> and pronounced <b>j-hat</b>.

    "To get your resultant (R) we simply add the above components of each vector, which gives:\n",

In the lower right and upper left quadrants this would mean that our angle is negative. Don't worry about this right now. You can just take the absolute value and call it 56.4˚. Of course, we want to always give the heading from north so we will subtract it from 180˚ for a final heading of 124˚.<br>\n",
